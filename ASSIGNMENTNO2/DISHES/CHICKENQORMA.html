    <h1> CHICKEN QORMA</h1>
    <P> Chicken Korma is traditionally made from yogurt, coconut milk, and almonds, making it one of the mildest chicken
        curries. The thick and creamy sauce has a sweetish tang to it coming from the coconut and almonds and is usually
        made with tender chicken chunks and served with rice.</P>
