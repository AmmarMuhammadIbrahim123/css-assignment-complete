    <h1> CHICKEN BIRYANI</h1>
    <P> Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are
        steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender
        texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.</P>
