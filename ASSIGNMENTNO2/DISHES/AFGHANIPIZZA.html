    <h1> AFGHANI PIZZA</h1>
    <P>Afghani pizza is a unique and delicious twist on traditional pizza that incorporates flavors and ingredients from
        Afghan cuisine. While it may not be as well-known as Italian or American-style pizzas, Afghani pizza offers a
        distinct taste that appeals to many people.

        Afghani pizza typically starts with a thin crust that is similar to traditional pizza dough. However, the
        toppings and spices used set it apart</P>
