    <h1> CHICKEN PULAOO</h1>
    <P> This one-pot flavoured chicken pulao rice recipe is cooked with mild Indian spices. Chicken pulao is a delicious
        dish made of boiled basmati rice, meat, spices, and herbs. This chicken rice is super easy to make for a
        weeknight dinner. It is mildly spiced compared to its counterpart chicken biryani.</P>
