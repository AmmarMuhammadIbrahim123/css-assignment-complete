    <h1> VANILLA ICECREAM</h1>
    <p>Vanilla ice cream is a classic and widely enjoyed flavor of ice cream. It is known for its smooth, creamy texture
        and rich, sweet taste with a hint of vanilla.The base of vanilla ice cream is typically made with a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and sometimes eggs.
        Vanilla extract or vanilla bean is added to infuse the ice cream with the distinct and aromatic flavor of
        vanilla. The mixture is churned in an ice cream maker to incorporate air and create a smooth and creamy
        consistency.</p>
