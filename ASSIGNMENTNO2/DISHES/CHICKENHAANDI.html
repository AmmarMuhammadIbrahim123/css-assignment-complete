    <h1> CHICKEN HAANDI</h1>
    <P> Chicken Handi translates to chicken in clay pot. Traditionally this curry is made in a terrocota pot which
        imparts its unique flavour to this dish. Handi Chicken dish is a traditional North Indian style curry,
        slow-cooked in a copper or earthen clay pot (called handi) with aromatic spices, yogurt, cream, and fragrant
        herbs. For a home cook like us, we can use any heavy bottom pot or pan instead of the traditional clay pot.</P>
