    <h1> MANGO DELIGHT</h1>
    <P> Mango delight is a layered mango dessert made with mango, cream, biscuit, and condensed milk. Nuts are usually
        used to garnish. Two common variations in this recipe are the use of mango custard instead of cream and an
        additional layer of mango jelly at the bottom of the dish.</P>
