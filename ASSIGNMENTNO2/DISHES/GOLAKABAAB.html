    <h1> GOLA KABAAB</h1>
    <p> These succulent Pakistani Gola Kabab are the perfect addition to your Bakra Eid (Eid ul Adha) table. Made with
        beef or mutton their exotic taste and tenderness makes them very addictive. If you do not like red meat, you can
        also use chicken mince. I gave them a little spin by stir-frying some bell pepper, cherry tomatoes and red onion
        and placed the kabab over them.
