    <h1> CHEESE PIZZA</h1>
    <P>Although a Margherita pizza is technically a cheese pizza, a 'regular cheese pizza' is a more basic meal with
        just tomato sauce topped with cheese. Typically a cheese pizza will also use mozzarella but other cheeses such
        as parmesan may also be mixed in the toppings </P>
