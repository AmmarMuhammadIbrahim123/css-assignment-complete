    <h1> BEEF BIRYANI</h1>
    <P> Biryani has two main components: fluffy, fragrant basmati rice and a delicious saucy beef (or your choice of
        protein) curry or masala. AND, it’s super delicious.It’s also what I would say the equivalent of Sunday roast in
        Pakistan, as it’s almost always made once a week either on Friday (mostly) or Sunday in most households in
        Pakistani. And usually when Biryani is in the making, Zarda a sweet rice recipe is also made on the same day as
        dessert. It is a lovely and popular combination.</P><br>
