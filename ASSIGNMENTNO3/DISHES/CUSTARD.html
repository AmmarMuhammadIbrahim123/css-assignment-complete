    <h1> CUSTARD</h1>
    <P> Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on sweetened milk, cheese, or cream cooked with egg or egg
        yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary
        in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (crème anglaise) to the thick pastry cream (crème pâtissière) used to
        fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include
        sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche.</P><br>
